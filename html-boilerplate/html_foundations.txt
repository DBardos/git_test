Always name the html file containing the homepage "index.html" because servers will look for
    an index.html page by default when users land on our web pages.

Every html page starts with a doctype declaration.
In the case of HTML5, this declaration is:
    <!DOCTYPE html>

Then, provide an html element: the root element of the document, meaning that every other
    element in the document will be a descendent of the root.


The <head> element is where meta-information regarding the document is placed. Including
    information needed for webpages to correctly render in the browser.
    
    The charset meta element is nested in the head element.
        Always have the meta tag fpr the charset encoding of the webpage in the
        head element : <meta charset="UTF-8">
        The encoding ensures that special characters and symbols from different languages
        are displayed correctly in the browser.

    Another element to be included in the head of the document is the <title> element:
        <title> First webpage </title>
    The title element gives a readable title to the page.
    In lieu of a title element, the file name would by default apply to the websites title.

The <body> element is where text, images, lists, links, etc. go within an html document. The body
    element goes within the html element and is always below the head element.

HTML documents can be opened in the terminal by chrome with the command: 
    google-chrome <filename.html>
